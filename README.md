# Mocav

An experimentel vehicle routing problems solver based on Monte Carlo method. Mocav is not a production-grade VRP solver, for now. Thus use it at your own risk. It doesn't perform well if the job numbers increases. Any contributions are welcome.

## Run

See the helper via:

`python3 vrp.py --help`

To run multiple solver at a time, check `run.sh`.
